# Light Switch

This script allws you to quickly switch between two themes and matcaps at the same time.
Usefull when working in changing light situations, but also handy when cleaning up edges after boolean operations or just to better see dark mesh areas.

Set up the theme folder as well as the themes and matcaps you want to use in the script.
