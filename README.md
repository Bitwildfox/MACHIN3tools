# Center Cube

If nothing is selected, places a cube at the cursor location, but with X zeroed out, enters edit mode, selects all and initiates the scale tool. If objects are selected, it zeroes out x.
This allows for quick, precise additions and alignment of geometry, without having to manually center them on the x axis using the N panel.

Default Key: Shift + C

# Clipping Plane Toggle

This script allows for quick toggling through 3 different clipping plain values. Useful when you need to get very close to some vertices, or when you need to see and select through overlapping geometry. Toggle back to a bigger valuei, when you are zoomed out again, to avoid "bleeding edges" on the bounderies of your objects or viewport AO creating a moire pattern.
The clipping values will also influence how close "View Selected" will focus on your selection.

# Light Switch

Useful when working in changing light situations, but also handy when cleaning up edges after boolean operations, to get a fresh look at your model and re-evaluate it in different "light conditions" or just to better see dark mesh areas.

Set up the theme folder as well as the themes and matcaps you want to use in the script.

# Multi Mirror Mirror
This script wraps around Rob Fornof's excellent Mirror Mirror Tool(https://github.com/fornof/BlenderAddons/blob/master/MirrorMirrorTool.py) and adds support for mirroring a selection of objects at once.

Default Key: Shift + Alt + X/Y/Z

# Shading Switch
Switches between Material and Solid shading modes. Also re-assigns Z key for wireframe switching, and Shift + Z for render switching dynamically according to the current shading mode.
This allows for consistent use of the Z and Shift + Z keys across those two shading modes.
