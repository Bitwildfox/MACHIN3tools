# Light Switch

This script allows for quick switching between two themes and matcaps at the same time.
Usefull when working in changing light situations, but also handy when cleaning up edges after boolean operations, to get a fresh look at your model and re-evaluate it in different "light conditions" or just to better see dark mesh areas.

Set up the theme folder as well as the themes and matcaps you want to use in the script.
