# Light Switch

This script allows for quick switching between two themes and matcaps at the same time.
Usefull when working in changing light situations, but also handy when cleaning up edges after boolean operations, to get a fresh look at your model and re-evaluate it in different "light conditions" or just to better see dark mesh areas.

Set up the theme folder as well as the themes and matcaps you want to use in the script.

Default Key: CTRL + Mouse Button 5 

# Clipping Plane Toggle

This script allows for quick toggling through 3 different clipping plain values. Useful when you need to get very close to some vertices. Toggle back to a bigger value when you are zoomed out again, to avoid "bleeding edges" on the bounderies of your objects or viewport AO creating a moire pattern
The clipping values will also influence how close "View Selected" will focus on your selection.

Default Key: Mouse Button 5
